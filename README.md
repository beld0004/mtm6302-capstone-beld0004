In order to design the layout and structure, I made a file for HTML and CSS.

I needed to fetch the data from PokeAPI through Javascript so that I can ensure that the information is accurate.

Resources used:
PokeAPI
Github Repository

Challenges faced: 

The challenges I have faced in no particular order are: 

1. Waiting for the API to work
2. Making sure that everything is going to show up as per my mockup
3. Making it accessible through Web, Phone, and Tablet (Interactive)

I overcame these challenges by making sure that I looked back upon the previous courses of the program and through the IMD Coding website. It was very hard for me to make the javascript work as there are broken codes and I had to keep validating it, but it works out at the end.
