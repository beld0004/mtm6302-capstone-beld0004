Introduction
This report explains how I made the Pokedex web app. It talks about what I did, what tools I used, and any problems I have faced.

What I Did
Setting Up: I made the basic structure of the app using HTML, added style with CSS, and made it interactive with JavaScript.

Getting Pokemon Data: I used the PokeAPI to get information about different Pokemon species.

Showing Pokemon: I made the app display Pokemon pictures and names, and when you click one, you have to go to the bottom to catch the pokemon.

Catching Pokemon: When you click on a Pokemon, you have to go to the bottom to catch the pokemon.


Tools I Used

PokeAPI: Got Pokemon data from here.
GitHub: Stored my project files here.
VSCode: used this to write code.
Google Chrome DevTools: used this to test and fix problems.

Problems I Had
Waiting for Data: Sometimes, it took time to get data from PokeAPI, so I had to make sure everything still worked smoothly.

Making Things Update: When you catch a Pokemon, the app had to update to show it, and that was tricky to get right.

Dealing with Rules: I had to figure out how to get around some rules when getting data from PokeAPI.

Conclusion
Making the Pokedex web app was fun but challenging. I managed to make it work well, letting users explore and catch Pokemon easily. However, the layout was not working as I kept breaking the code, therefore I had to make do with the code I had.
