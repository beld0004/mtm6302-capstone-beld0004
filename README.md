I have decided that I want to do a grid style page with white spacing on the either side to make the design clean, sleek and simple.

The colors I have picked are :

BG: B8F54E
White 
Red for the selection of Captured Pokemon: F26666



Background: 
I have chosen a light green for the background because in order to see the captured Pokemon while still seeing their sprites, it needed to be a light color. 
White:
For the border/background of the Pokedex title, I decided to use white to contrast the green background.
Red:
For the selection of the captured pokemon, I have chosen red because this will prompt the user that the captured pokemon is captured.
